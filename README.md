# Gesture-Based Musical Notation Editor – Backend Java Application with GUI

## Overview
This project is a **musical notation system editor** developed as part of a Java class led by **Lecturer Marlin Eller at NEU Seattle**. Over one semester, we designed and built an editor that allows users to create and manipulate musical symbols through **gesture-based input**.

Developed using **IntelliJ IDEA**, the system integrates both the **Music Editor** and the **Shape Trainer** within a **single window** — users can seamlessly switch between editing and training modes by simply clicking the **button in the top-right corner**.

## Installation & Usage
1. Install the provided font: `sinfonia.ttf`
2. Run `MusicED.java` to launch the combined notation editor and shape trainer.(draw notes, stems, etc.).
   ✍️ Draw lines, place musical symbols, train new gestures — all within one unified window.
   🔁 Use the top-right toggle button to switch between Music Editor and Shape Trainer modes.

## Technologies
- **Programming Language:** Java
- **Architecture:** MVC (Model-View-Controller)
- **GUI Framework:** Swing
- **Additional Features:** Shape Trainer, Gesture Recognition

## Contributions & Highlights
🎯 **Designed and implemented** a real-time gesture recognition system that accurately interprets user-drawn musical symbols.
🎯 **Developed a unified GUI interface** that dynamically toggles between editing and training modes, all within the same application window.
🎯 **Enabled dynamic staff and system creation**, allowing users to flexibly create multi-staff musical content.
🎯 **Implemented multi-layer rendering** for precise symbol positioning and clean visual output.
🎯 **Built an intuitive undo system** for easy action reversal and improved usability.
🎯 **Delivered a successful live demonstration** showcasing real-time gesture training and music editing.

## Features
- 🎵 **Gesture-Based Input**: Users draw musical symbols naturally, improving workflow and intuitiveness.
- ✍️ **Integrated Shape Trainer**: Train and test new gestures without switching programs — just click the toggle in the top-right corner.
- 📐 **Multi-Layer System**: Ensures correct layering and alignment of musical elements.
- 🔄 **Undo Functionality**: Edit with confidence using quick action reversal.
- ⚡  **Real-Time Interaction**: Instant feedback and updates as gestures are performed.
